#Sorting algorithm

a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.
Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists.

Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:

The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).
The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.

Classification

Best, worst and average case behavior in terms of the size of the list. For typical serial sorting algorithms, good behavior is O(n log n), with parallel sort in O(log2 n), and bad behavior is O(n2). Ideal behavior for a serial sort is O(n), but this is not possible in the average case. Optimal parallel sorting is O(log n).
Swaps for "in-place" algorithms.
